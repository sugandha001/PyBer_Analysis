# PyBer_Analysis

The purpose of this Analysis is to provide ridesharing data for the company Pyber. We wrote Python scripts using Pandas libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The analysis and visualizations will help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Result of our Analysis

Based on the chart we deduced from the data we can see that urban cities generate the most total revenue, followed by suburban and then Rural cities.

To analyze fare for riders we generated a table.



As this table displays the number of rides in urban city is way more than number of rides in rural cities and so is total number of drivers. So, it is evident that Average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much more in Rural cities than Urban cities.

Based on above analysis we can deduce that -

1) More revenue is generated in urban cities for PyBer.
2) Average fare is less for urban city riders.
3) Rural areas have less number of drivers and hence they make less.

## Recommendations based on summary analysis

1) A further detailed study should be conducted to analyse the shortage of drivers in rural areas. If the demand is enough to justify more drivers then PyBer should consider hiring more drivers.
2) More drivers can be hired in suburban cities too. 
3) Since Pyber is generating more revenue in Urban cities and our data indicates that there are more drivers than rides in urban cities, pyber may consider investing in marketting and trying to increase the number of riders so existing drivers can make motre and stay with the company.
